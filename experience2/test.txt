The DESCRIPTION and ERRORS sections are updated so that references to STREAMS are marked as part of the XSI STREAMS Option Group.

The following new requirements on POSIX implementations derive from alignment with the Single UNIX Specification:

The DESCRIPTION now states that if read() is interrupted by a signal after it has successfully read some data, it returns the number of bytes read. In Issue 3, it was optional whether read() returned the number of bytes read, or whether it returned -1 with errno set to [EINTR]. This is a FIPS requirement.

In the DESCRIPTION, text is added to indicate that for regular files, no data transfer occurs past the offset maximum established in the open file description associated with fildes. This change is to support large files.

The [EOVERFLOW] mandatory error condition is added.

The [ENXIO] optional error condition is added.

Text referring to sockets is added to the DESCRIPTION.

The following changes were made to align with the IEEE P1003.1a draft standard:

The effect of reading zero bytes is clarified.

The DESCRIPTION is updated for alignment with IEEE Std 1003.1j-2000 by specifying that read() results are unspecified for typed memory objects.
